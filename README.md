# TS-GQL

A simple Node graphql server written in TypeScript.

The motivation for this repo is to be a template to use as a starting point when creating new projects. This way I don't need to do the same basic setup of creating and authenicating users and such.

Additionally, I wanted to try making a graphql server that didn't use Apollo, as I found that using that library for toy projects was way overkill.

## TO-DOs

- [ ] Get basic Express server running
- [ ] Add database and ability to store users
- [ ] Add ability to update users
- [ ] Add authenication flow
- [ ] Add authorization mechanisms
